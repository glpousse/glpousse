ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, 

I am a masters student @ScPoEcon in Paris and looking to build my coding skills in R and @julialang. 
This year I will be following @floswald's class in [Computational Economics](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods). 

My goal with this page is to share my work and any attempts. I may occasionally share some STATA code.

You can reach me at guillaume.pousse@sciencespo.fr
